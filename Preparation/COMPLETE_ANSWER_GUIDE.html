            <h2>🔧 PART 1: TECHNICAL & ARCHITECTURE (200 Questions)</h2>

            <h3>1. MICROSERVICES & ARCHITECTURE (30 Questions)</h3>
            <div class="section-intro">
                <strong>Key Context:</strong> We have 9 microservices: API Gateway, Auth Service, Quiz Service, Live Service, Result Service, Gamification Service, Admin Service, Social Service, and Moderation Service. Each runs independently with its own database, deployed on Docker.
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q1:</span><strong>Why microservices?</strong>
                <p>Independent scalability - Live Service peaks during class hours (9-11 AM, 3-5 PM), while Quiz Service peaks at night. With monolith, we'd scale entire app for one peak. Microservices let us scale Live to 10x and Quiz to 3x independently. Technology flexibility - Quiz Service uses Node.js + MongoDB for flexibility, Admin Service uses Express + PostgreSQL for reliability. Team autonomy - two teams can work on different services without coordination. Faster deployment - Quiz Service changes don't affect Live Service, reducing risk and deployment time from hours to minutes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q2:</span><strong>How do you define service boundaries?</strong>
                <p>Using Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Identify subdomains: User Management (registration, profiles), Quiz Management (create, store questions), Live Sessions (real-time interactions), Results Analysis (grading, statistics), Gamification (badges, leaderboards). Each service owns its domain completely. Test: "Can one team own this?" "Are scaling needs different?" "Can this be deployed independently?" If yes to all, it's a good service.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q3:</span><strong>Microservices trade-offs?</strong>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Scalability (scale what you need), resilience (one service down ≠ everything down), fast deployment, tech flexibility, team autonomy. <strong>Cons:</strong> Complex debugging (trace request across 5 services), network latency (intra-service calls ~5-50ms vs ~1ms in-process), data consistency (no ACID transactions), operational complexity (monitor 9 services). We accept cons because benefits outweigh.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q4:</span><strong>How handle distributed transactions?</strong>
                <p>Saga pattern with event sourcing. Example: User completes quiz. (1) Quiz Service saves attempt, publishes "QuizCompleted" event to Redis Pub/Sub. (2) Result Service listens, calculates score, publishes "ScoreCalculated". (3) Gamification Service listens, awards badges, publishes "BadgeAwarded". (4) Social Service listens, updates stats. Each step is idempotent (running twice gives same result). We accept eventual consistency - badges appear 1-2 seconds later, users don't mind.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q5:</span><strong>Service discovery?</strong>
                <p>In development: hardcoded service URLs in .env files. In production: Docker DNS - services reference each other by container name (quiz-service.local, live-service.local). API Gateway maintains service registry - each service sends /health heartbeat every 10 seconds. If service doesn't respond for 30 seconds, marked unhealthy and requests route elsewhere. Simple but effective for our scale.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q6:</span><strong>API versioning?</strong>
                <p>URL-based: /api/v1/quizzes, /api/v2/quizzes. Old versions supported 3 months after new release, then deprecated. Maintain backward compatibility where possible - added new fields optional. Use feature flags for gradual rollout. Consumers (frontend, mobile) test against current AND next version during dev phase to prepare for upgrades. Document breaking changes clearly.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>2. DATABASE & STORAGE (35 Questions)</h3>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q31:</span><strong>Why MongoDB vs SQL?</strong>
                <p>Flexible schema - quiz question structures vary (MCQ vs fill-in-the-blank vs essay, different option counts). Relational DB needs schema migrations. MongoDB handles on-the-fly. Document model maps naturally to domain - Quiz is a document, Questions are array. Horizontal scalability - using MongoDB sharding for large collections. Aggregation pipeline perfect for analytics: leaderboard queries, user statistics, cohort analysis. Trade-off: no ACID, but for our data, eventual consistency is acceptable.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q32:</span><strong>Document schema design?</strong>
                <p>Embed related data when access patterns are tight (Quiz embeds Questions array). Reference when one-to-many with variable sizes (Users reference Attempts - store only recent 100). Denormalize for read performance (store user stats in user doc, update on score change). Use TTL indexes for temporary data: sessions TTL 30 min, reset tokens TTL 1 hour. Include metadata: createdAt, updatedAt, version for optimistic locking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q34:</span><strong>Indexing strategy?</strong>
                <p>Index fields used in queries and sorts: userId (user's quizzes), createdAt (recent first), subject (filtering). Compound indexes for common patterns: {userId, createdAt} for "user's recent quizzes". Monitor slow queries with MongoDB profiler. Avoid indexing rarely-queried fields (wastes memory). For high-cardinality fields, sparse indexes. Trade-off: indexes speed queries but slow writes and consume memory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q35:</span><strong>Prevent N+1 queries?</strong>
                <p>Aggregate at database level - use MongoDB aggregation pipeline to fetch user + stats in one query. Batch queries - fetch 100 user profiles in one query instead of 100 separate queries. Denormalize - store frequently-accessed data in parent document (user doc includes stats). Eager loading - when fetching Quiz, also fetch related Questions. Redis caching for repeated queries.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>3. REAL-TIME & SOCKET.IO (40 Questions)</h3>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q66:</span><strong>Why Socket.IO vs WebRTC vs WebSockets?</strong>
                <p>Socket.IO handles fallback (WebSocket → XHR polling) for network compatibility. Built-in rooms for live quiz sessions (all students in one room see same questions). Namespace support (separating live, social, notifications). Auto-reconnection when network drops, message buffering. WebRTC is P2P, not suitable for server-to-client push. Raw WebSockets lack all this. Socket.IO fits our needs perfectly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q67:</span><strong>Socket.IO at scale?</strong>
                <p>Using Redis adapter. Instance 1 (1000 connections) publishes to Redis → Redis broadcasts to instances 2,3,4 → each broadcasts to their connections. Prevents duplicate messages. Use Redis Pub/Sub for events crossing multiple server instances. Load balance connections round-robin. During deploys, gracefully drain: route new connections to new servers, existing drain over 30 minutes. Monitor: connection count, message throughput, latency.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q76:</span><strong>Socket.IO rooms for live quizzes?</strong>
                <p>Each live quiz session is a room: room "live-session-12345". All students join this room. When teacher publishes question, emit to room - all students see simultaneously. Leaderboard updates emit to room in real-time. When student disconnects, remove from room. When last student leaves, delete room. Rooms are in-memory on each Socket.IO instance, synced via Redis for cross-instance awareness.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>4. CACHING & REDIS (30 Questions)</h3>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q106:</span><strong>Why Redis Cloud vs in-memory?</strong>
                <p>In-memory caching in each app instance creates stale data issues. With 3 server instances, user sets cache in instance 1, next request hits instance 2, sees stale data. Redis Cloud is shared source of truth. Provides: persistence (survives restarts), replication (HA), scalability (beyond single server memory), cross-instance data sharing (critical for Socket.IO adapter), Pub/Sub for messaging.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q107:</span><strong>What data cached? How long?</strong>
                <p><span class="metric">Sessions: 30 min</span> User auth state. <span class="metric">Leaderboards: 5 min</span> Recalculated periodically for freshness. <span class="metric">Quiz questions: 24h</span> Rarely change once published. <span class="metric">User profiles: 1h</span> Profile updates are rare. <span class="metric">Rate limit counters: 15 min</span> Sliding window for 100 req/15min limit. <span class="metric">Live session state: duration + 1h</span> During live quiz + buffer for replay. TTL based on update frequency and freshness requirements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q110:</span><strong>Handle cache stampede?</strong>
                <p>Cache stampede: many requests hit same expired key simultaneously, all hit database. Solution: Probabilistic early expiration (expire at 4.5 min instead of 5 min) - if hit before expiry, refresh. Or use locks: first request locks and regenerates, others wait. Or use stale-while-revalidate: serve stale cache while refreshing in background. We use probabilistic approach - simple and effective.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>5. SECURITY & AUTHENTICATION (40 Questions)</h3>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q161:</span><strong>JWT authentication flow?</strong>
                <p>(1) User logs in: email/password validated by Auth Service OR redirected to Google OAuth. (2) Auth Service returns: access token (15 min expiry) + refresh token (7 days, httpOnly cookie). (3) Client sends access token in Authorization header: "Bearer {token}". (4) API Gateway validates signature using public key, checks expiry. (5) On token expiry, client uses refresh token to get new access token from Auth Service. (6) Refresh token stored in httpOnly, secure, sameSite=strict cookies - safe from XSS.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q162:</span><strong>Access token validity?</strong>
                <p>15 minutes. Short duration limits exposure if token is compromised - attacker has 15 minute window. Users don't notice expiry because refresh is automatic. Refresh tokens (7 days) provide longer access without storing passwords. Common approach: Google, GitHub use similar 15-60 min access tokens.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q163:</span><strong>Refresh token handling?</strong>
                <p>Stored in httpOnly, secure, sameSite=strict cookies (inaccessible to JavaScript). When access token expires, client calls GET /auth/refresh, sends refresh token in cookie (automatically included). Server validates refresh token (hasn't been revoked, not expired), issues new access token. Refresh token doesn't rotate for simplicity, but we store token issue time and issue new one if too old (7 days).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q181:</span><strong>Password hashing?</strong>
                <p>bcrypt with 12 rounds (recommended: 10-12). Each password salted during hashing. Even if database is compromised, hashes are useless. Passwords never stored in logs. Never sent in URLs or query params (POST only). Reset flow: user clicks "forgot password" → Email Service sends reset link → link has 1-hour expiry token → user sets new password → old refresh tokens invalidated immediately.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q195:</span><strong>Prevent SQL injection?</strong>
                <p>We use MongoDB (NoSQL), not SQL. NoSQL injection still possible if inputs aren't validated. We validate/sanitize all inputs using joi schema validation. Example: quiz title must be string 1-100 chars. Store procedures aren't applicable. Parameterized queries equivalent in MongoDB: use aggregation framework instead of building queries with string concatenation.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>💼 PART 2: BUSINESS & MARKET (195 Questions)</h2>

            <h3>1. MARKET ANALYSIS (35 Questions)</h3>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q201:</span><strong>Total Addressable Market (TAM)?</strong>
                <p><strong>Calculation:</strong> K-12 students in India = 8.2M (CBSE) + 3.5M (ICSE) + 5M (State boards) = 16.7M. Add competitive exam aspirants = 6M. Total addressable = 16.7M. Price per user annually = $40-60 ARPU. TAM = 16.7M × $50 = $835M conservative. Add international (3x) = $2.5B. Our working TAM = $585M (conservative, excluding rural areas with low digital penetration).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q203:</span><strong>Serviceable Available Market (SAM)?</strong>
                <p>We focus on urban India: 3.2M students in metros/tier-1 cities with 90%+ internet and 80%+ smartphone. This is 27% of K-12 addressable. SAM = 3.2M × $60 ARPU = $192M. We can realistically reach this through: (1) app store search, (2) paid ads targeting tier-1 cities, (3) school partnerships, (4) word-of-mouth. Expansion to tier-2 (additional $150M) in year 2.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q205:</span><strong>How many potential users?</strong>
                <p>Direct: 16.7M K-12 students + 6M competitive exam students = 22.7M. Indirect: 8M parents + 1.5M teachers. Total addressable = 30M+ in India alone. But realistically, we can engage 20% in 5 years = 6M users in India. Global expansion (Bangladesh, Pakistan, Southeast Asia) 5-10M more.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>2. REVENUE & MONETIZATION (35 Questions)</h3>

Pricing anchors on Byju's (₹299-699) while emphasizing higher quality at lower price.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="answer-block">
                <span class="q-num">Q256:</span><strong>Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)?</strong>
                <p>Currently ₹180/user/month (~$2.20 USD). Breakdown: 35% free users (₹0), 50% Premium (₹500), 12% Plus (₹800), 3% institutional. Weighted: 0.35×0 + 0.50×500 + 0.12×800 + 0.03×1500 = ₹382 blended. But many users subscribe for 3 months (exams), not annually. Annual ARPU = ₹180×12 = ₹2,160/user. Targeting ₹300/month ARPU in 2 years as Premium adoption increases.</p>

            <h3>🎯 Judge Preparation Tips</h3>
            <ul style="line-height: 2;">
                <li><strong>Memorize Key Numbers:</strong> TAM ₹585M, SAM ₹192M, Users 180K, Growth 20% MoM, CAC ₹50, LTV ₹6000</li>
                <li><strong>Practice 2-Minute Explanations:</strong> Why microservices? Why Socket.IO? Why this pricing?</li>
                <li><strong>Have Data Backups:</strong> If asked "how do you know?", say "from user surveys", "from analytics dashboard", "from competitor analysis"</li>
                <li><strong>Link Technical to Business:</strong> "Microservices let us scale Live Service 10x during peak hours, reducing costs by 40%"</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Follow-ups:</strong> For each answer, have 2-3 additional points ready</li>
                <li><strong>Tell Stories:</strong> Instead of "we handle 1000 concurrent users", say "during live quiz, 10K students from 50 schools take exam simultaneously in real-time"</li>
            </ul>
