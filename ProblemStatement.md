1. AI Quiz Portal (Platform Replication(like Kahoot) with AI Quiz 
Generation) 
Goal: 
 Design and develop an online quiz platform that enables real-time quiz participation, 
live leaderboard tracking, and one-click AI-based quiz creation for learners, educators, 
and organizations. 
Description: 
 In today’s fast-paced digital learning environment, quizzes play a vital role in engagement, 
assessment, and skill evaluation. However, existing quiz tools often lack interactivity, 
automation, and scalability. This challenge focuses on building a next-generation quiz 
platform that blends AI intelligence, real-time engagement, and seamless user 
experience. 
Requirements: 
● Host live multiplayer quizzes 
● Real-time scoring and leaderboard updates 
● Admin dashboard for quiz management 
● AI feature: Auto-generate quizzes from text, PDFs, or topics 
● Scalable backend (microservices preferred) 
● Responsive and smooth frontend (React preferred) 
 
 
Bonus: 
● Analytics dashboard 
● Adaptive quiz difficulty using AI 
● Integration with speech-based questions 
Expected Outcome: 
A fully functional prototype that allows users to: 
● Create quizzes using AI in seconds 
● Host and join real-time sessions 
● Compete on a live leaderboard 
● Analyze performance post-quiz 
Impact: 
Such a platform can revolutionize edtech engagement, corporate learning, and 
hackathon/game-based learning environments by merging AI automation with real-time 
interaction.
